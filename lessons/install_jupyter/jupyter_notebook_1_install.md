# Jupyter Notebook:  Getting Started
The Jupyter notebook is an interactive computational environment, in which you can combine code, execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media.

### [Install the Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
Installing Jupyter using Anaconda and conda:  
For new users, we highly recommend [installing Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.  (Prereq: Python is installed.)

Once anaconda is installed, you can launch the notebook by typing
```{bash}
$ jupyter notebook
```

### Upgrade all libraries/packages
We will now update all the packages/libraries installed by anaconda to ensure you have the latest version of everything!

```{bash}
$ conda update --all
```

### Run the Notebook at Terminal Prompt  
Note:  The notebook will open at the directory in which you launch the notebook on your terminal.  
```
$ jupyter notebook
```
